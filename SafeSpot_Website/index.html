      <p><b><i>SafeSpot</i></b> is a camera-based app created for nursing homes that uses computer vision and cloud-based machine learning algorithms to detect signs of injury or danger. If the algorithms detect a problem, the app will automatically trigger an alert and send notifications to designated emergency contacts.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <div class="problem">
        <p>As the number of elderly population is constantly growing, there is an increasing demand for home care. In fact, the market for safety and security solutions in the healthcare sector is estimated to reach $40.1 billion by 2025.</p>
        <p>The elderly, disabled, and vulnerable people face a constant risk of falls and other accidents, especially in environments like hospitals, nursing homes, and home care environments, where they require constant supervision. However, traditional monitoring methods, such as human caregivers or surveillance cameras, are often not enough to provide prompt and effective response in emergency situations. This results in potentially serious consequences, including injury, prolonged recovery, and increased healthcare costs.</p>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div class="solution">
        <p>The proposed app aims to address this problem by providing real-time monitoring and alert system, using a camera and cloud-based machine learning algorithms to detect any signs of injury or danger, and immediately notify designated emergency contacts, such as healthcare professionals, with information about the user's condition and collected personal data.</p>
        <p>We believe that the app has the potential to revolutionize the way vulnerable individuals are monitored and protected, by providing a safer and more secure environment in designated institutions.</p>

        <div style="display: flex">
          <img src="img/5.svg">
        <p style="flex: 82%;"> Apart from the web, the platform could also be implemented as a mobile app. In this case scenario, the alert would popup privately on the userâ€™s phone and notify only people who are given the access to it.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <img src="img/6.svg">
      <p style="flex: 82%;"> The app could also be integrated with wearable devices, such as fitness trackers, which could provide additional data and context to help determine if the user is in danger or has been injured.</p>
